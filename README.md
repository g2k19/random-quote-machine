## API

This project uses the [ZenQuotes API](https://zenquotes.io/) to fetch the quotes. The API provides:
* Random quotes with authors
* Does not require authentification
* Has rate limit (FREE version only), which is why you might not be able to always get a new quote

## Development Approach

This project was intentionally built using **only Bootstrap** for styling (no custom CSS) as a personal challenge.
